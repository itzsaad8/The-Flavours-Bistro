We take time and effort to source locally produced, quality ingredients in our food, and with over 20 years of cooking experience we can offer you the very best of what Pembrokeshire has to offer.  Sustainability is also very important to us and we pride ourselves in using biodegradable packaging for our Takeaways, that can be composted or disposed of so there is no consumer guilt.</p>
                            <p>The Box is a family run business and we provide an easy going, friendly service. If you have any allergies or general preferences please don’t hesitate to contact us, as our food is all cooked fresh we can easily make adaptions where necessary, given enough notice. </p>
